# Converging magnetic systems in CP2K

Magnetic systems are common in nature, and present unique challenges for electronic structure calculations. In this tutorial I will explain how to calculate magnetic structures in CP2K, and share some techniques to accelerate SCF convergence. The techniques discussed are applicable to all magnetic systems, and may be helpful for other challenging convergence problems such as defects in crystals.
